The data contained in the exampleRPackage R package was analyzed exactly like detailed in this document.

First, because the data is contained in a package, we can easily call it from R

```{r}
library(macrogrow)
```

We used the `T_lim()` function:

```{r}
my_seaweed <- c(T_opt = 20, T_min = 5, T_max = 30)

T_lim(Tc = 22, spec_params = my_seaweed)

T_range <- 1:30
sapply(T_range, T_lim, spec_params = my_seaweed)
```
